      "But it's just not been the same for a while I guess? Like idk da we used to get on call like a lot during June July stressing on placement and stuff, but after that just feels she just like idk grew apart is a stretch, forgot is also a stretch but yes\n",
      "Exactly what I was coming to😭\n",
      "17/10/2025, 00:36 - Arnitha: Okay I genuinely see your point, cause I remember her telling maddy is one person in ece who I am emotionally really close to, she used to tell me in 6th sem\n",
      "17/10/2025, 00:37 - Arnitha: And yea I see your point da...okay so in your mind in top  can you think of any reason or event that lead to this or it like just happened ?\n",
      "17/10/2025, 00:39 - Madhavan: Bro nothing da..\n",
      "Like see she got placed I congratulated hyped and vice versa \n",
      "Other times, like I said no I was feeling like too low at some point and got sloshed\n",
      "That time as well, I wanted to share but idk bro I just felt like I should be the last thing she'd want right then\n",
      "17/10/2025, 00:40 - Madhavan: Cuz she was preparing her paper and stuff\n",
      "17/10/2025, 00:40 - Arnitha: Oh okay....genuinely fair\n",
      "17/10/2025, 00:41 - Arnitha: Yeaa valid\n",
      "17/10/2025, 00:42 - Madhavan: Like bro what I'm tryna tell is, this has kinda been a trend\n",
      "Like i sense people getting further, I also kinda start rejecting, but still I do efforts.. but after one point always from the other side, they just don't care ig? Idk they've never said or anything but my assumptions\n",
      "\n",
      "So like that's why I'm afraid to make bonds, like what if the same thing happens again?\n",
      "17/10/2025, 00:42 - Madhavan: Idk what I'm blabbering da😭\n",
      "17/10/2025, 00:45 - Madhavan: Like bro even with you\n",
      "This last week or so, it's been honestly soo amazing \n",
      "Nothing in the last few months has even come close to last week da\n",
      "And bro you'll soon be working, I'll soon be working and bro idk da idk what I'm feeling and istg these insta reels like quickly catch on and they spawn reels about my reality and i just get confused and sad?\n",
      "17/10/2025, 00:46 - Arnitha: Bro bro see I don't know much about others bonds but knowing hiral and you(obviously still getting to know ) this is not the case where she doesn't care about you or stopped caring \n",
      "\n",
      "I can see there is been maybe some misunderstanding from her part and yk she's going through sm and eventually because of that you didn't share much , and I'm gonna be honest with you bro, she was telling me how she wants to start meeting all other guy friends whom she is close to ( I'm assuming you and hari and all ) because after breakup she hasn't hung out much and how she wants to hang out alone with all of them \n",
      "\n",
      "So maybe you guys should really have this conversation da and one hang out which she is literally planning to ask in some time \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And also bro, you are such an amazing person, nobody would want to lose you as a friend ,and if they did their lose\n",
      "17/10/2025, 00:46 - Arnitha: Loss*\n",
      "17/10/2025, 00:46 - Madhavan: Honestly like today, i went to DRDO because I had to submit my report hard copy, and I went there for a while\n",
      "That's when these things crept in\n",
      "And the ride back was honestly brutal\n",
      "I don't even know when I left and when I came back\n",
      "I was angry? I was idk da\n",
      "17/10/2025, 00:51 - Arnitha: Bro I totally totally get it \n",
      "\n",
      "And bro see, we didn't even like know know each other a month back and now in just last week, you come under the list of people whom I text everyday ( trust me it's not a lot ) \n",
      "\n",
      "And bro it really scares me that 8th sem is gonna change everything,  but bro maybe it's not gonna be the exact same but the bond is still gonna be the same da \n",
      "\n",
      "And bro I don't make close friends a lot da, if I do then I'm so sticky 😭\n",
      "So like don't worry bro , you are slowly getting close to me and I don't let people who get close to me get away that easily da \n",
      "\n",
      "And bro stop watching insta reels ,trust me ,I know what you are talking of cause I get so many break up reels ,friendship reels, like how in corporate life barely you will have time and all that, but bro it's not that deep to text 10 mins in a day with close friends or like meet once in a month to do something in common with friends \n",
      "\n",
      "Trust me it's not \n",
      "\n",
      "In worst cases if not monthly ,it's gonna be 2 months once \n",
      "Dynamics will change bro , but we will still be happy da ,cause that's the whole purpose\n",
      "17/10/2025, 00:51 - Arnitha: Okay and I don't know what I typed and I'm blabbering or some shit but I really mean it\n",
      "17/10/2025, 00:52 - Arnitha: Shit bro...what exactly happened da..\n",
      "17/10/2025, 00:52 - Madhavan: Bro yeah like that too\n",
      "Like id said I hung out with you and how amazing it was\n",
      "I also like just said we both alone have never hung out\n",
      "But she like dropped that subject? Like bro see, if the other person isn't comfortable I'm not the kind to pressure.. so I too like just went on with how awkward it was when that Shashank dude asked. Then she said if jai Kumar or hrithik asked also its fine..\n",
      "Im overthinking for sure, but why do I feel like she doesn't want to hang out alone? And bro like not just this once, couple of times \n",
      "Im seriously spiraling idk bro\n",
      "17/10/2025, 00:54 - Madhavan: Bro bro yeah I totally get it da😭\n",
      "17/10/2025, 00:54 - Arnitha: Bro okay I totally see your pov da trust me \n",
      "Okay bro I'm gonna tell you this..it was long back tho, a month or so ,not like a secret or anything but like she was telling me how she never wants to lose you and Hari in her life da\n",
      "17/10/2025, 00:55 - Madhavan: Bro like same here da.. \n",
      "Idk like \n",
      "okay this might come out really strange\n",
      "17/10/2025, 00:57 - Arnitha: And how she wants to ask you guys to hang out ,and I'm sure it's not Jai or Hrithik because she thinks they are not her close friends and they are all reel sharing friends , so it means you and Hari only da \n",
      "\n",
      "I wanted her to tell you this,  but I feel it will really help you so I'm gonna tell it , she's like she will ask you to go to vijaynagar food street with her cause it's been so long and she told smg for Hari and some other junior guys i don't remember 😭( I didn't ask her more )\n",
      "17/10/2025, 00:59 - Madhavan: But okay in 5th sem right, I really wanted to do DBMS minors, because my mom said me\n",
      "But hiral asked to do OS and I felt soo happy, because that was one of the few times we could like hangout. Because I could barely get hold of her, and like it was nice\n",
      "But I'm 6th sem, all my buddy's were doing DBMS, and like no one was doing DAA but it was her last and like idk something unanimously in me took the decision to take DAA\n",
      "Idk how is this even related\n",
      "Idk what I'm blabbering\n",
      "17/10/2025, 01:00 - Madhavan: Bro that's actually soo sweet da\n",
      "17/10/2025, 01:00 - Arnitha: But also I totally see why you feel what you feel, if I were you I would feel the same da\n",
      "Obviously she's been busy with band and now bareily,  but she could you have been more specific about it \n",
      "\n",
      "And bro obviously there is something you gotta be open to her about(like this distant thing ) you don't need to tell in detail initially,  but maybe just telling hey, it's been so long we hung out da, and like are we fine ?\n",
      "17/10/2025, 01:00 - Arnitha: That's all\n",
      "17/10/2025, 01:01 - Arnitha: Bro that's genuinely sweet da ,I totally get what you are blabbering da \n",
      "You guys were not same class also, so it's nice to have some class in common\n",
      "17/10/2025, 01:01 - Madhavan: Like bro\n",
      "I really dont want to loose her I really really don't\n",
      "Idk some negative demon in me is spiralling me a lot da\n",
      "17/10/2025, 01:03 - Madhavan: Bro actually \n",
      "See I want to delete insta, and I think I will too da\n",
      "For like sometime\n",
      "17/10/2025, 01:04 - Madhavan: But sorry da\n",
      "I really don't know what I wanted to convey, what I want. Bro i seriously don't know\n",
      "17/10/2025, 01:04 - Arnitha: Bro I totally get it da , trust me \n",
      "\n",
      "And bro I would totally suggest you to just ask once if you guys are fine from her side too when you guys hangout cause I assure you she legit told me she planning to ask you for vijaynagar street food and stuff, idk when she will ask cause bareily and all, but just saying da, she literally has the thought too\n",
      "\n",
      "So you are not alone in this feeling da,  she doesn't wanna lose you too, it's been so circumstantial \n",
      "You guys really need to talk it out da \n",
      "Cause bro the number of times she's told that you are such a good friend even when I didn't know you is a lot ,trust me\n",
      "17/10/2025, 01:05 - Madhavan: And I haven't replied to any of your messages da but I have read them like twice maybe\n",
      "Sorry for not replying to them da😭\n",
      "17/10/2025, 01:05 - Arnitha: Bro genuinely valid da\n",
      "17/10/2025, 01:05 - Arnitha: Bro that's totally okay cause I somewhat see what you are trynna say\n",
      "17/10/2025, 01:05 - Arnitha: I genuinely di\n",
      "17/10/2025, 01:05 - Arnitha: Do*\n",
      "17/10/2025, 01:06 - Arnitha: Bro bro as long as it helps you atleast 1% , I'm happy\n",
      "17/10/2025, 01:06 - Madhavan: Bro yeah da I will text her..\n",
      "Maybe after a while? This weekend?\n",
      "17/10/2025, 01:06 - Madhavan: Bro actually thank you da\n",
      "17/10/2025, 01:07 - Arnitha: And bro okay, one thing I do know is she told she wants to ask you for lunch cause it's been long , and she has the same feeling too, it's been circumstantial for both of you\n",
      "17/10/2025, 01:07 - Madhavan: Can I like tell one more thing?\n",
      "Please don't get mad\n",
      "17/10/2025, 01:07 - Arnitha: Bro yea weekend actually da \n",
      "She leaving to bareily on Saturday \n",
      "So Sunday/ Monday maybe ?\n",
      "17/10/2025, 01:08 - Arnitha: Bro guess what, I know your place I'm gonna come and boink your head , please tell me how much ever you wanna tell da 😭\n",
      "17/10/2025, 01:10 - Madhavan: Bro sometimes I envy how natural it is for girls to cry? Like sorry for like categorising, assuming and all the big words\n",
      "But for men it's actually hard to cry and let out da\n",
      "Idk lots of things like pile up \n",
      "And atleast for me, recently like small puffs tbeyre bubbling out. And I am aware of it and I kinda brush it out\n",
      "But idk bro I'm seriously scared one day I'm gonna erupt and like hurt everyone\n",
      "Im really not ready for that da\n",
      "17/10/2025, 01:13 - Madhavan: Bro istg, for my own grand father's death (mom's side) he used to ask me to come and meet him soo many times\n",
      "I barely cried when he passed away, but I get that thought soo many times, I want to cry.. he was the sweetest person bro\n",
      "But i just don't.. i just compress try to smile, be happy, help.\n",
      "17/10/2025, 01:13 - Arnitha: Bro I get it you are not ready for it cause I have heard that from my other guy friends also da , but like bro ,trust me or not ,I used to not cry till second sem at all, till second sem, I might have cried 3 times in total(like in my whole life )\n",
      "\n",
      "And if there is one person can understand you in this it's me \n",
      "\n",
      "I hated crying cause I saw it as vulnerability da, but later I realised it's not if you feel that much daa\n",
      "\n",
      "Till 4th sem I didn't cry in front of anybody,  but started crying alone and it was way worse da \n",
      "\n",
      "Now it's somewhat better but even in 5th sem I used to feel so weird crying da esp in front of hiral or amg\n",
      "17/10/2025, 01:14 - Arnitha: And like my own dad had heart attack and I didn't cry da\n",
      "17/10/2025, 01:14 - Arnitha: So I totally get you bro\n",
      "17/10/2025, 01:15 - Madhavan: Oh shit da..\n",
      "17/10/2025, 01:16 - Arnitha: Bro shit I get that da..\n",
      "\n",
      "Okay bro I can tell you what I did but idk if it will help \n",
      "Bro what stops you from crying exactly \n",
      "Do you feel because it makes you weak or you scared that you are gonna open an another side that you Don't want to\n",
      "17/10/2025, 01:17 - Arnitha: Bro yea so I get\n",
      "Whole of 11th and 12th, I cried exactly once da \n",
      "\n",
      "I was not like this before,  like blunders happen also I used to not cry , cause I saw it as it makes me look weak\n",
      "17/10/2025, 01:17 - Arnitha: And I'm not weak\n",
      "17/10/2025, 01:17 - Arnitha: But I was so wrong da\n",
      "17/10/2025, 01:17 - Madhavan: It used to always be it's not that big of a deal?\n",
      "Or that I've never seen my dad cry?\n",
      "17/10/2025, 01:18 - Arnitha: Smiling it off is always the second option which happens naturally da , but you feel better like if you cry\n",
      "17/10/2025, 01:18 - Arnitha: I'm not gonna lie to you\n",
      "17/10/2025, 01:18 - Arnitha: It's gonna be draining asf initially\n",
      "17/10/2025, 01:18 - Arnitha: Cause you start and then you keep on crying cause it's a closed door which I am guessing exactly what's with you\n",
      "17/10/2025, 01:19 - Arnitha: And you can't close, but bro I can genuinely eventually help da ,cause I have gone through it somewhat\n",
      "17/10/2025, 01:20 - Arnitha: Bro yea , I get it cause I used to think it's not big of deal, crying is just gonna make the problem bigger and I don't wanna look weak\n",
      "17/10/2025, 01:21 - Arnitha: I'm not saying cry because it's cool da , but I'm saying eventually can take baby steps to let it out than smiling everything off\n",
      "17/10/2025, 01:21 - Arnitha: Cause bro that will make you stronger than you think da\n",
      "17/10/2025, 01:21 - Arnitha: I meant once you open a closed door , it gotta fully open and it takes energy\n",
      "17/10/2025, 01:21 - Madhavan: Bro yeah.. idk when that floodgate will open\n",
      "And yeah I can relate to the weak part\n",
      "Because on the grand scale, isn't this petty things (im soo wrong in thinking this)\n",
      "But in future well have a lot more to worry about da\n",
      "So yeah I think inside yes the thought of looking weak is soo true\n",
      "17/10/2025, 01:22 - Madhavan: Bro yeah\n",
      "I still don't know how to let it out\n",
      "Eventually one day (hopefully not too late)\n",
      "17/10/2025, 01:23 - Arnitha: Bro we are always gonna have bigger problems da\n",
      "Isn't life about looking back and laughing at it \n",
      "But at that moment ,it is big da\n",
      "17/10/2025, 01:23 - Madhavan: Bro yeah I get what you saying\n",
      "17/10/2025, 01:23 - Madhavan: That is actually soo fucking true bro\n",
      "17/10/2025, 01:24 - Arnitha: Bro yeah I can totally see the old me in you😭like totally \n",
      "\n",
      "Beleive me or not I still don't cry in front of my family. Like ever \n",
      "The only people I have cried in front is Hiral, Harsha ,you ,nidhi that's all\n",
      "\n",
      "I can't tell you how much I see myself in you rn\n",
      "17/10/2025, 01:24 - Madhavan: Broo😭😭\n",
      "17/10/2025, 01:25 - Madhavan: Damn da\n",
      "17/10/2025, 01:25 - Arnitha: No bro I get it's easier for girls ,I don't fall under that category 😭\n",
      "17/10/2025, 01:25 - Arnitha: Ig too much of elder daughter core\n",
      "17/10/2025, 01:25 - Arnitha: God knows\n",
      "17/10/2025, 01:26 - Madhavan: Bro I'm like actually soo sorry da\n",
      "It's just growing up we've come through that environment j\n",
      "Like really sorry for categorising, assuming?\n",
      "17/10/2025, 01:26 - Madhavan: 😭😭\n",
      "17/10/2025, 01:27 - Madhavan: Bro and like just one last thing da?\n",
      "17/10/2025, 01:28 - Arnitha: Bro see, it can start 3 ways \n",
      "You journal it out ,like start writing it down and eventually you will open up a lot and cry it out with yourself or you can call your friends ( anybody actually and I will be more than happy to help)\n",
      "I started with sharing da, Journaling didn't help me a lot initially,  and when I was sharing to a friend and I ended up pouring my heart out and crying about it\n",
      "17/10/2025, 01:29 - Arnitha: Bro that's okay genuinely okay cause 80% of them it's easy\n",
      "\n",
      "Bro to hiral itself,  I cried for the first time maybe in 4th or 5th sem or so\n",
      "Its so hard to open up and cry\n",
      "\n",
      "I am dying inside and I just go like yea not a biggie ( inside I'm dying )\n",
      "17/10/2025, 01:30 - Arnitha: And bro if you ever want someone to open up and talk about this or anything ,or you at your lowest, I'm one call or text away da 🫂\n",
      "17/10/2025, 01:30 - Arnitha: Ofc bro go on\n",
      "17/10/2025, 01:31 - Arnitha: And I remember I was sharing it and kept on saying omg how weak do I look 😭😭and that person is just like you look crazy for thinking that 😭 <This message was edited>\n",
      "17/10/2025, 01:33 - Arnitha: Bro I have never cried in front of my dad or mom \n",
      "Sometime brother , but never them \n",
      "I just can't \n",
      "I might be having a crisis but I'm all laughing and good when I'm in front of them\n",
      "17/10/2025, 01:35 - Madhavan: Is it wrong to have no expectations at all? \n",
      "Like see me I get attached very easily and quickly\n",
      "And sub-counciously I expect a lot? Or atleast expect. This used to be long back\n",
      "Bro now i actually have lost it? Or its diminished? \n",
      "Definitely toned down, otherwise I wouldn't have been soo upset with the thing with hiral\n",
      "But like the things with that ruthu also, I kinda am heading with no expectations at all\n",
      "\n",
      "But bro, the way I see Harsha and you, bro it makes me soo happy da. Like bro idk inside i just need that too. Like it kills me, and beleive it, it used come in the form of lust in second year. I have never said to anyone this, but i used to be disgusted everyday with myself\n",
      "17/10/2025, 01:39 - Madhavan: Bro yeah, journal I have tried it da\n",
      "But again, the thing called privacy does not exist at all here\n",
      "Like okay I have never said this as well to anyone\n",
      "But I started smoking around feb this year? Because my dad had to get a open heart surgery, and I didn't know how to express, because my sister was always there for him. I too helped him a lot. But the appreciation that my sister used to get and my mom just trusted her more, killed me. So I started smoking a lot. And one day mom found out a pack, drama happened\n",
      "And that was the first time i cried in front of my parents in 10 years\n",
      "Before that maybe once in 4th or 5th or 6th don't remember id cried\n",
      "17/10/2025, 01:39 - Arnitha: Bro okay 2 things \n",
      "It's not wrong to have expectations da but ig life eventually teaches you to have less expectations cause bro they ALWAYS HURT \n",
      "(atleast for me)  \n",
      "So I wouldn't say to have 0 expectations cause I don't think so it's good da , but not to have lot of expectations is also better da\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And bro I also get attacked too quickly like too easily that's why I'm so careful cause I have been hurt before \n",
      "And bro as long as expectations are diminished but still there a bit it's fine da  \n",
      "\n",
      "Yea and the fact that hiral thing shows you care for somebody who you want in your life ,and as long as that much is there you are all good bro\n",
      "\n",
      "And with Ruthu bro,trust me that's the right attitude da \n",
      "( life has taught me that this is the best way da , I might be wrong but )😭\n",
      "17/10/2025, 01:40 - Madhavan: So yeah what Im saying, I will start.\n",
      "But before i used to hide things. I think if I don't try too hard. There's no problem at all\n",
      "17/10/2025, 01:41 - Madhavan: Bro yeah da that's what\n",
